## Instructions for pushing

NOTE: always pull changes from the master/main branch before adding/committing/pushing.
	  Failing to do so will result in annoying conflicts.

1) git add .
	- this line stages changes made to any files in addition to new files created
2) git commit -m "<your message describing the commit here>"
	- this line creates a commit, updating the HEAD of your local repo copy
3) git push origin master
	- this line pushes the new commit(s) to the master branch of the repository hosted by git
	- NOTE: github changed the 'master' term to 'main' in light of recent events...
