               <h4> Computer Vision Indentification <br>
                for Smart Bird Feeders </h4>

                <div class = "paragraphs" >
                  Over 50 million people spend approximately 40 billion
                  dollars on gear and traveling to participate in bird watching, every year.
                  David Plemmons, bird enthusiast and entrepreneur, has been working over the
                  last 3 years to bring the bird-enthusiast community even
                  closer together by creating a bird feeder with an
                  integrated camera that allows you to view birds from a live stream video.
                  <br>
                  David's plan is to educate people on the importance
                  of bird-watching and bird indentification. From a scientific perspective,
                  the identification of individual birds would present avian researchers
                  with a completely new dimension of data. This would allow researchers
                  to better study trends within different bird populations. <br>

                  Team Bird's iView is going to expand David's idea and create an
                  AI model that will be able to identify specific species
                  of birds from the images captured by the pEEp bird
                  feeder. Additionally, we will be creating an easy way to share
                  user findings which will allow users to connect with other
                  members of the bird community.
