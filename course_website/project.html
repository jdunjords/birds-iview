           <h2> Description </h2>
           Our project, Computer Vision Indentification
           for Smart Bird Feeders, will encourage the expansion of the bird-enthusiast
           community. We will be creating a web application for David Plemmons,
           the owner and creator of pEEp bird feeders.
           We will be implementing an AI model that will be able to indentify
           species of birds from the photos provided by the pEEp bird feeder. As
           well as creating an easy way to share user images.

           <h2> Requirements </h2>



           <h2> Limitations </h2>
           The current limitations are not having a reliable way to indentify bird
           species from the photos taken by the pEEp bird feeder. Meaning,
           users do not have an expert to confirm their bird classifications.
           Additionally, there is no organizational system for the users to share
           their images. Lastly, users are unable to track individual birds who could
           possibly be frequent visitors.

           <h2> Solution </h2>
           Our solution is to great a GUI for image organization that allows for
           photo sharing, image capturing, and naming of the birds. <br>
           As stated previously, we will also be implementing a learning AI model
           that will be able to identify bird species by the provided images.
           Specifically, our AI model will be trained to indentify species by their
           beak shape, eye position, and any other unique features. <br>
           Lastly, we will implement forums and online sharing for user submitted data
           to further build the community.
